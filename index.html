            <h3>Atlanta, the city of Georgia</h3>
            <p>
              Atlanta is one of the country’s great urban centers. In the
              southeastern US–where it’s located–this so-called City in a Forest
              serves as a regional hub for both culture, finance, and education.
              It is also strategically located Birmingham, the Alabamian state
              capital, lies approximately two hours away from Atlanta.
              Meanwhile, Nashville in neighboring Tennessee is due north–about a
              four-hour drive away. Another state capital, Columbia in South
              Carolina, is three hours east of the city.
            </p>
            <p>
              People here enjoy the outdoors. Parks, like Piedmont Park in
              Midtown and Centennial Olympic Park downtown, are prevalent
              throughout Atlanta, and it's common to see people taking advantage
              of these urban oases with a game of ultimate Frisbee or a family
              picnic. The parks also provide the perfect locations for Atlanta's
              numerous festivals that bring people out in droves.
